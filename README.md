<!--Data used to overwhelm me, so I learned how to reshape it. Now I make clear, friendly dashboards and tools that help people understand their data.  
I help mission‑driven teams turn raw data into decision‑ready insights and dashboards. Dashboards that boost data literacy and chase the kind of future Octavia Butler would smile at.
